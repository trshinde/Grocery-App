 Implemented an responsive UI for grocery list of items with the kind of brand, category, quantity of item ,etc in an flex-box CSS.
 Added hovering and transition CSS animation on the 8 object boxes of flex box container.
 
 Developed considering certain constraints:
 1) Breakpoint between large size, medium size and small size brower windows,
 2) Cross browser compatibility,
 3) Proper code convention with comments by making use of Vanilla JS to read JSON file.
